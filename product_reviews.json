Home » Breville Cafe Roma Review: Can This Espresso Machine Keep Up? BREVILLE CAFE ROMA REVIEW: CAN THIS ESPRESSO MACHINE KEEP UP? The beginner-friendly Breville Cafe Roma is a perfect machine for the novice barista looking to bring the espresso experience home for the first time. Are you in the market for your first home espresso machine? Maybe you’ve realized you’re spending too much money at the local coffee shop or you’re wondering if you can make a tastier drink at home. Or maybe you’re just excited to break into the compelling world of pulling your own espresso shots. No matter your reason, I think the Breville ESP8XL Cafe Roma Espresso Maker is an excellent option for the budding home barista. It’s affordable, easy to use, and teaches you the critical skills required to further your espresso education. Keep reading for my honest and in-depth Breville Cafe Roma espresso machine review to find out if it’s the right entry-level espresso maker for you. What I Liked: Entry-level espresso machine is easy to use Durable and attractive stainless steel exterior Includes all necessary accessories Froth-enhancing steam wand for reliable frothed milk What I Didn’t Like: Outdated thermoblock heater No control over steam pressure Somewhat overpriced The Full Breville Cafe Roma ESP8XL Review First released in 2004, Breville’s Cafe Roma is one of the brand’s oldest models. It has yet to see an update in recent years, so it definitely has a bit of an outdated feel. However, as the most affordable Breville espresso machine , I still think it serves an important role in the product line. It’s a perfect starter espresso machine, equipped with everything the home barista needs to craft café quality beverages. And it’s so easy to use that even beginners will be pulling smooth shots of espresso with thick layers of crema. How We Rated It Brewing Capacity Ease Of Use Coffee Flavor Build Quality Value For Money 3.9 See On Amazon What To Expect From The Brewing System The Cafe Roma uses a 15-bar pump and single thermoblock heater to generate the high-pressure hot water required for extraction. A thermoblock is a relatively old technology and is a significant difference between the Cafe Roma and the newer models. Most Breville machines have been upgraded with improved thermocoil heaters, while some have the more advanced proprietary ThermoJet system. Compared to these updates, a thermoblock offers slightly poorer temperature stability, which affects the quality and consistency of your espresso shots – though an espresso novice is less likely to notice a taste difference. What you will notice, however, is that the thermoblock takes longer to heat up. Plan on letting it warm for at least 2 – 3 minutes before brewing (5 – 10 minutes is even better), compared to 30 seconds for a thermocoil or 5 seconds for a thermojet. Because the same heater is used for making espresso and steaming milk, you can’t do both simultaneously. This is pretty standard for an espresso machine at this level, but the thermoblock means you’ll need to wait a little longer than average when switching between the two processes. What size portafilter does Breville Cafe Roma use? I was surprised to find that the Cafe Roma uses a tiny 50 mm portafilter. Most Breville espresso machines use 54 mm, while the commercial standard is 58 mm. A small filter diameter isn’t inherently bad, but it does mean you’ll need to shop around a little if you want to buy accessories like a metal tamper. Milk Frothing With A Manual Steam Wand The Cafe Roma comes with a manual steam wand, complete with a froth enhancer. I think this design strikes a nice balance between user-friendliness and control. The froth enhancer guarantees a lovely pillowy milk foam even if you don’t have a practiced hand. But you’ll st"

What to Buy Coffee & Tea Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista Review An inexpensive espresso machine that simplifies espresso-making By Cheyenne Elwell Cheyenne Elwell Cheyenne Elwell is a writer for The Spruce Eats specializing in food and coffee. She has written for Business Insider, MSN, and her own coffee blog. Learn about The Spruce Eats' Editorial Process Updated on 09/20/23 4.5 Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista The Spruce Eats / Cheyenne Elwell What We Like Easy to use Quickly makes espresso drinks Semi-automatic Low-cost What We Don't Like Time-consuming cleanup Espresso is weak Tamper is poorly made With its quick, easy setup and semi-automatic system, the Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista is perfect for anyone looking to start making espresso drinks from home. Editor's Note: We first reviewed the Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista in 2019. Since then, we've continued to test it against other espresso/cappuccino machines . Thanks to its ease of use and reasonable price, we can confidently say it's one of our top picks, especially for beginners. Buy on Amazon Buy on Walmart 4.5 Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista The Spruce Eats / Cheyenne Elwell Buy on Amazon Buy on Walmart In This Article Expand Design Setup Process Performance Ease of Cleaning Price Competition Final Verdict Specs We purchased the Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista so our reviewer could put it to the test in her kitchen. Keep reading for our full product review. If you’re in the market for an espresso/cappuccino machine , there is a wide spectrum on the market ranging from low-budget to top-of-the-line options. Some espresso machines are completely manual and require a lot of time and energy but leave plenty of room for customization. Others function completely automatically. One middle-ground option is the Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista. We took this semi-automatic machine for a spin and made many drinks with it to determine how well it delivers on quality, setup, ease of use, cleanup, and price. Take a look to see the final results. The Spruce Eats / Cheyenne Elwell Design: Conveniently designed We found that the overall design of this coffee maker was well-thought-out because all of its parts are labeled clearly. This helped a lot when we first started using the machine. Plus, parts are all removable, which is convenient for cleaning and refilling. The buttons on the front of the machine are clearly labeled with the corresponding drink, and there are manual and automatic options. The milk reservoir conveniently fits within the unit, and it’s removable, so leftover milk can be stored in the fridge when not in use. The frother also has a clearly labeled knob that controls how much froth goes into each drink. There is an included measuring spoon that doubles as a tamper, used for pressing the coffee grounds into the portafilter. There are two filters that fit into the portafilter: one for a single shot and one for a double shot. Additionally, there are two drip trays. One tray sits within the unit underneath the portafilter, catering to full-size mugs. The second tray pulls out from underneath the milk reservoir, creating less room for the espresso to spill out for those who prefer a smaller cup. The water reservoir in the back is removable so the user can easily fill it up, dump out any excess water after usage, and clean it. As for aesthetics, this machine is both sleek- and modern-looking. We have the silver version with black details, and it easily fits in with the rest of our kitchen appliances. The Spruce Eats / Cheyenne Elwell Setup Process: Simple and straightforward We found the setup for the Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista to be simple. This was partly due to the simplicity of the machine but can also be attributed to the included instructions, which were easy to understand. Before using it for the first time, we needed to wash all of the removable parts with warm water and soap. We also had to prime the machine, which involved running i"

Reviews ethics statement Home Kitchen & Household Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista review: An automatic espresso machine that makes lattes almost robotically Priced at $200, the Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista brews coffee and steams milk for lattes and other drinks almost entirely by itself. Brian Bennett Former Senior writer Brian Bennett is a former senior writer for the home and outdoor section at CNET. See full bio Brian Bennett Oct. 8, 2015 7:18 a.m. PT 5 min read Enlarge Image The Mr. Coffee Barista doesn't have over-the-top style but blends in well. Tyler Lizenby/CNET 6.6 Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista $200 at Walmart $200 at Target $150 at Amazon The Good The Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista automatically pulls shots of espresso, steams milk, and creates cafe-style coffee drinks at the push of a button. The coffee maker also has a removable milk reservoir that's refrigerator-friendly for easy storage. The Bad Like many entry-level home espresso machines, the Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista has trouble brewing at consistent temperatures and coaxing pleasant flavors from lightly roasted beans. The machine also gets clogged easily by very finely ground coffee. The Bottom Line Making lattes and other cafe-style drinks is hard work, and the Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista successfully automates much of the process, but consistently pulling straight shots of quality espresso is out of this machine's reach. There's a good reason why you often pay through the nose for lattes, cappuccinos and other cafe-style drinks at your local java joint. Combining steamed milk with concentrated espresso coffee, these fancy beverages are made to order and are labor-intensive compared with ordinary pots of drip coffee. For a reasonable $200, however, the Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista will tackle much of this tricky process and with tasty results. The kitchen gadget automatically pulls espresso shots on command and even combines them with freshly frothed milk right inside your cup to make cafe favorites with minimum effort. Of course, this coffee maker is no super-automatic espresso machine that handles everything including grinding and weighing beans. A contraption like that will easily set you back thousands of dollars. Neither can the Cafe Barista deliver straight espresso quality to match those premium brewers or more sensible options such as the $300 De'Longhi Dedica. Still, if you seek a frugal way to sip real espresso-based drinks without having to do much work then the Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista will satisfy. Design I doubt when shoppers hear the name \"Mr. Coffee,\" images of luxurious materials or unconventional industrial designs come to mind. Neither will it draw the eye like the chrome-plated and decidedly European-looking De'Longhi Dedica. That said, this machine is attractive enough to blend in with the backsplashes of modern kitchen counters. Measuring 12.4 inches tall by 10.4 inches wide and 8.9 inches deep, the Cafe Barista is quite compact, even for pint-size drip coffee brewers such as the Bonavita BV1900TS . As far as a pump espresso device goes, however, this is a sizable appliance. It's slightly larger than the less capable (and cheaper) Mr. Coffee Pump Espresso Maker ($90). Side-by-side with the De'Longhi Dedica, the Cafe Barista plainly dwarfs the smaller machine. Enlarge Image The milk reservoir is removable and even can sit in the fridge. Tyler Lizenby/CNET One reason for the Barista's increased girth is its special reservoir for milk. Not only is the tank removable, it features a built-in wand for steaming when attached to the brewer and can be stored in the fridge for the next time you need it. Like most home espresso contraptions, the Cafe Barista comes with a portafilter for both brewing shots and loading the machine with grounds. It's essentially a metal filter attached to a sturdy handle that you must lock tightly into place under the Cafe Barista's brew head. Mr. Coffee also includes two filter baskets to choose from, for single and double shots. Enlarge Image Before you brew you must fill the portafilter with ground coffee. Tyler Lizenby/CNET "

Reviews ethics statement Home Kitchen & Household DeLonghi EC155 Pump Espresso review: Underpowered espresso on a budget Serious espresso addicts won't be blown away by the $100 DeLonghi Pump Espresso's erratic shot quality but casual cappuccino and latte drinkers will find plenty to love in this compact and affordable machine. Brian Bennett Former Senior writer Brian Bennett is a former senior writer for the home and outdoor section at CNET. See full bio Brian Bennett Sept. 12, 2015 5:00 a.m. PT 5 min read Making decent espresso-style drinks at home doesn't have to be exorbitantly expensive. For a modest $100 (£110 in the UK) the DeLongi EC155 Pump Espresso can whip up satisfying espresso, lattes, and cappuccinos, and without eating up too much countertop real estate. 6.0 DeLonghi EC155 Pump Espresso $240 at Walmart $269 at Amazon The Good The DeLonghi EC155 Pump Espresso is compact, affordable and makes very tasty espresso-based drinks paired with steamed milk. The Bad Unfortunately the DeLonghi EC155 lacks the power and temperature control to pull consistently delicious espresso shots. The machine also has trouble extracting flavor from medium and lightly roasted beans. The Bottom Line If all you seek in a home espresso machine is the odd cappuccino or latte, then the budget-minded DeLonghi EC155 Pump Espresso is tempting. However aficionados won't be impressed by its erratic coffee quality. Of course this small machine is no stand in for elite and more robust espresso makers. Saddled with a weak vibratory pump, a single boiler and erratic water temperature control, the EC155 is tricky to operate with consistent results. It also gets bogged down by ultrafine grinds and has difficulty extracting all the subtle flavors locked within medium and lightly roasted coffee beans. That said, if your espresso tastes lean towards the more traditional dark roasts and have a penchant for adding a dollop of steamed milk then the DeLonghi EC155 Pump Espresso is a very affordable and tasty option. Design Closer in size to small pod-style coffee makers, the DeLonghi EC155 measures 10.5 inches tall by 7 inches wide by 8.25 inches deep. It also tips the scales at a mere 7 pounds, 2 ounces making it a cinch to transport around the house or even out the door. Another convenient aspect of the appliance is its removable water tank. Holding 34 ounces (1 L) of liquid, the square-shaped reservoir is easy to pull out or drop into the espresso machine thanks to its built-in handle. And since the tank has a flat bottom you can rest it worry-free on tables and counters for quick fills. Enlarge Image The Pump Espresso is a very small coffee appliance. Tyler Lizenby/CNET As you'd expect from an espresso machine, the EC155 uses a portafilter device to both load, contain and brew its coffee grounds. Essentially a metal handle (with rubbery grip) on one end with a circular basket and filter attached to the other, the portafilter is built to withstand the high pressures and temperatures of espresso brewing. When properly mounted, the portafilter screws tightly into place within the grouphead at the center of the machine. DeLonghi thoughtfully includes two metal filters with the EC155, one to handle single shots and another for creating double shot coffees. Both filters share the same circumference and drop neatly inside the portafilter basket. The major difference between the two are their depth and recommended ground coffee capacity. The shallow single shot filter accepts 7 grams (0.2 ounce) of coffee while the deeper dual shot filter tops out at 12 grams (0.4 ounces). Enlarge Image The portafilter screws onto the bottom of the grouphead. Tyler Lizenby/CNET I found the EC155 Pump Espresso's few controls easy enough to use. On the front face of the machine is a big dial, what DeLonghi calls the \"selector knob.\" The dial has four marked positions, and associated symbols, which kick the product into various operation modes. These include resting, heating, espresso brewing and steaming. To the right of all these icons is a temperature indicator light which glows gree"

Home » Delonghi EC155 Review: A Perfect Intro To Espresso DELONGHI EC155 REVIEW: A PERFECT INTRO TO ESPRESSO Read my Delonghi EC155 review to find out if it’s the right model to begin your espresso journey. Being new to espresso culture can leave your head swimming. From the array of possible features to the huge range in pricing, it’s hard to figure out where to start. Well, let me make it easy for you. The Delonghi EC155 is a great starting point. With a low price tag, easy-to-use interface, and compact design, this is the machine I most often recommend to beginners. What I liked: Simple one-dial interface Beginner-friendly frothing attachment Stainless steel boiler Small countertop footprint What I didn’t like: Small filter basket limits coffee dose Awkwardly placed plastic tamper Plastic build is less durable than metal The Full Delonghi EC155 Review The De’Longhi EC155 Espresso and Cappuccino Maker brings the local coffee shop home, allowing you to craft rich and satisfying coffee shop drinks in the comfort of your kitchen. Its small footprint, easy-to-use interface, and affordable price tag make this my favorite espresso machine for beginners looking to dip their toes in the world of espresso for the first time. Note: Delonghi discontinued the EC155 in 2023, but you can still find it in many online marketplaces. It was replaced with an updated model, the Delonghi Stilosa , which I reviewed here. How We Rated It Brewing Capability Coffee Flavor Ease of Use Milk Frothing Cleaning and Maintenance Build Quality 3.8 See On Amazon Brewing Features And What They Mean Delonghi advertises the EC155 as a manual espresso machine, but that’s not technically correct. It’s a semi-automatic espresso machine, which is good news for you. The pressure needed to pull a shot is produced by the in-built 15-bar pump – not by hand. I was surprised and delighted to find that the EC155 uses a little stainless steel boiler instead of a thermoblock. The one boiler has two thermostats to independently manage the different temperatures for brewing and steaming. This is exceedingly rare in budget machines, and it yields a more stable brew water temperature, a key component of pulling a great espresso ( 1 ). “Many of the soluble compounds that we enjoy tasting in espresso will extract at the right concentration within a small temperature range.” The trade-off to a boiler versus a thermoblock is that it takes a little longer to heat up. You can get away with pulling a shot when the temperature indicator light comes on. But in my experience, it pays to let the EC155 warm up for at least ten minutes for the temperature to stabilize. What is the pressure of the Delonghi EC155? The Delonghi EC155 has a 15 bar pump, which is powerful enough to extract a proper espresso with a rich layer of crema. The recommended extraction pressure for an espresso shot is 9 bars. Contrary to popular belief, extraction pressure comes from the force of water against the puck of ground coffee. So properly preparing your portafilter is more important than whether your espresso maker has a 15-bar or 19-bar pump. How To Use The Delonghi EC155 To Make Espresso The Delonghi EC155 is a semi-automatic espresso machine, meaning you control the whole brewing process. I like this style of coffee maker because it teaches you the barista skills and workflow involved in crafting an espresso ( 2 ). But don’t let that intimidate you. Delonghi adds some nice user-friendly features to help you along the way. First, you’ll need to prepare the coffee puck. To do this, I use a burr grinder to grind 12 grams of coffee to a fine consistency. I add the grounds to the portafilter, distribute them evenly, and tamp as hard as I can. In my experience, it’s nearly impossible to over-tamp. T"

I wanted to provide an honest evaluation and compare it to other popular machines so that espresso lovers can make an informed choice.

Cuisinart EM 200 espresso maker arrives with: Espresso machine — The main brewing unit with a 15-bar pump pressure. Single and double shot portafilters — For brewing single and double espresso shots.

Overall, the Cuisinart includes everything a home barista beginner needs to start brewing espresso. Cuisinart has free shipping on all their espresso machines. My espresso machine arrived well-secured, and customer support answered my questions in a day.[ 1 ] Pulling My First Espresso Shot Here’s my experience pulling the first espresso shot on the Cuisinart EM200: I prepared the machine by cleaning all the necessary parts, filling the water reservoir, and letting the water run through the machine for a few seconds. I inserted the single filter basket into the portafilter. I used the scoop and placed ground coffee in the filter basket. I used the tamper to compress the coffee grounds. I brushed excess coffee from the portafilter rim. I secured the portafilter to the brew head. I checked that the power button was shining steadily and pressed the single shot button. That’s it. The machine automatically stopped pouring espresso at the programmed level. Overall, the process was simple. I had good espresso on the first try, and it only got better the more I used the coffee maker. I learned to preheat the portafilter and the cups and experimented with different grinds and pour times to get a truly great espresso.
